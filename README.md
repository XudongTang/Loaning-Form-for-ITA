# Loaning Form for ITA
## What is this
- This is the google form for loaning items within ITA
- The goal of this form is to track the inventory easier
- This is a beta test, and the whole "loaning form system" have a lot of flaws.
- The reponse of this form goes into a google spreadsheet, but I'm not sure if all stuff will have access to this sheet.
## How to use this form
- The form has 8 sections.
- Lender's Name: you should find your name in this drop down list, if your name is NOT on the list, please let me know.
- Borrower's Name: The student's name. You don't need to scroll down the whole list since there are 118 names. All you need todo is to type in the first name of the student and the list will find the match.
- Location: Currently we have four locations. 2146,CS B207, RS 105, RS 107. If you know where the item you are loaning out comes from, choose the location. You don't have to choose the location if you are not sure where the location is.
- Equipment: This is the tricky part. There are 4 major group: Device, Cable, Accessory and Other. I've already put some examples in the form and hopefully it might help you find the item you are looking for. If you could not find the item you are loaning out in any of these groups, choose other and scroll down to the last choice in the drop down list, then put the name of the item in the "additional info" section.(the last section)This means that I gave horrible name to those items and I'll change its name to a more reasonable one.
- S/N: this is the serial number. It's not necessary for you to put this in the form. However, if you are loaning out a laptop and it has a service tag, be sure to put the tag in this section.
- Label: The label we put on the device. It might be on a sticker or written in white markers. It looks like "MAD-001-017". If you could NOT find the label on the item, you dont have to put it in.
- Date: The date you fill out this form.
- Status: there are 3 status: Checked out, returned and repairing. for each status change of an item, one form is needed.(e.g. when a laptop is borrowed, fill the form with status "checked out", when it's returned, fill out another form with status "returned") If any unusual thing happened (item is missing, broken, etc), choose repairing and describe the situation in the additional info section.
- Addition info: other information that you think is necessary to write down.

## Note
- This is still a test, so the form might be a little bit hard to use. I apologize if it is causing additional trouble to you. Please let me know if you have improvement suggestion or the "form system" we use simply sucks. If you find BUGS, let me know as well since there is a google script program involved as well.
- Cheers!
